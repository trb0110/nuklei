## 2. Licensing Process

### Phased Approach

| Phase | Duration | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Site Evaluation | 2-3 years | Environmental studies, Safety analysis |
| Construction | 4-6 years | Permits, Inspections, QA/QC |
| Operation | 40-60 years | Periodic reviews, Compliance monitoring |
| Decommissioning | 10-15 years | Waste management, Site restoration |

---

## 3. Compliance Management

### Key Components

- **Regulatory Watch**
- **Gap Analysis**
- **Action Tracking**
- **Verification**
- **Reporting**

### Performance Metrics

| KPI | Target | Frequency |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| Regulatory Findings | 0 | Quarterly |
| Training Compliance | 100% | Monthly |
| Documentation Accuracy | 99.9% | Quarterly |

## 4. Legal Considerations

### Liability Regimes

| Country | Liability Limit | Insurance Required |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| USA | $450M | $450M |
| UK | €1.2B | €700M |
| France | €700M | €700M |
| Japan | JPY 120B | Full amount |
