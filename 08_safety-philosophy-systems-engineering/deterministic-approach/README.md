# Deterministic Safety Approach

This document outlines the deterministic safety methodology employed in the Nuklei framework, ensuring robust protection against design basis accidents through multiple, independent safety systems and defense-in-depth principles.

## Core Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth

### 2. Multiple Barrier Concept
- Fuel Matrix
- Cladding
- Reactor Coolant System Boundary
- Containment Structure

## Design Basis Accidents (DBAs)

### 2.1 Classification of DBAs
1. **Anticipated Operational Occurrences (AOOs)**
   - Turbine trip
   - Loss of off-site power
   - Minor reactivity excursions

2. **Postulated Initiating Events (PIEs)**
   - Loss of Coolant Accidents (LOCA)
   - Reactivity Insertion Accidents (RIA)
   - Steam Generator Tube Rupture (SGTR)

### 2.2 Safety Analysis

    E --> F{Success?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Safe Shutdown]
    F -->|No| H[Containment Response]
```

## Safety Classification

### 3.1 Safety Classes
- **Class 1**: Components whose failure could cause or allow unacceptable radiation release
- **Class 2**: Components that provide secondary protection
- **Class 3**: Components important to safety but with less severe consequences
- **Non-Nuclear Safety (NNS)**: Not safety-related but important for operations

### 3.2 Single Failure Criterion
- Safety systems must perform their function with any single active component failure
- Applies to all safety-related systems
- Includes consideration of common cause failures

## Implementation Requirements

### 4.1 Design Requirements
- Redundancy (N+2 or 2x100%)
- Diversity (different operating principles)
- Physical separation
- Environmental qualification

### 4.2 Testing and Maintenance
- Pre-service inspection
- In-service inspection programs
- Surveillance testing
- Maintenance rule compliance
