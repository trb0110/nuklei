# Waste & Decommissioning Strategy

## 1. Executive Summary

This comprehensive strategy document provides a detailed technical and operational framework for managing the entire nuclear fuel cycle with a focus on waste management and decommissioning. The strategy is built on four foundational pillars:

1. **Safety-First Approach**: Implementing defense-in-depth principles and ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) philosophy
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Adherence to international standards and national regulations
3. **Environmental Stewardship**: Minimizing environmental impact and ensuring long-term sustainability
4. **Economic Viability**: Cost-effective solutions throughout the facility lifecycle

## 2. Technical Framework

### 2.1 System Boundaries
- **Temporal Scope**: Covers facility lifecycle from site selection to final site release (100+ years)
- **Spatial Scope**: Includes all facility systems, structures, and components (SSCs)
- **Material Scope**: Encompasses all nuclear materials, radioactive waste, and hazardous substances

### 2.2 Performance Metrics

| Category | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) | Target | Measurement Method |
|----------|--------------------------------|---------|-------------------|
| Safety | Worker Dose (mSv/year) | <20 | Dosimetry records |
| Environment | Liquid Effluent (Bq/year) | <1E+10 | Effluent monitoring |
| Cost | Decommissioning Cost ($/kWe) | <500 | Lifecycle cost analysis |
| Schedule | Project Milestone Adherence | >95% | Schedule tracking |
| Waste | Volume Reduction Factor | >10:1 | Waste tracking system |

## 3. Integrated Waste Management System

### 3.1 Waste Classification Matrix

| Waste Class | Activity Range (Bq/g) | Typical Sources | Disposal Pathway |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| VLLW | <100 | Demolition waste | Landfill |
| LLW | 100-4E+6 | Operational waste | Near-surface |
| ILW | 4E+6-4E+11 | Reactor components | Intermediate depth |
| HLW | >4E+11 | Spent fuel, raffinate | Deep geological |

### 3.2 Treatment Technologies

| Technology | Application | Volume Reduction | Cost ($/m³) | Maturity |
|------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|----------|
| Supercompaction | LLW/ILW metals | 3-5x | 500-1000 | TRL 9 |
| Plasma Arc | Mixed waste | 10-50x | 2000-5000 | TRL 7 |
| Molten Salt | HLW | 100-1000x | 10000+ | TRL 4 |
| Bio-remediation | Soil/water | 2-5x | 100-300 | TRL 6 |

## 4. Decommissioning Strategies

### 4.1 Strategy Comparison

| Parameter | DECON | SAFSTOR | ENTOMB |
|-----------|-------|---------|--------|
| Duration | 5-10 y | 30-60 y | 100+ y |
| Cost ($/kWe) | 300-500 | 100-300 | 50-150 |
| Worker Dose (man-Sv) | 10-20 | 5-15 | 1-5 |
| Waste Volume (m³/We) | 0.03-0.05 | 0.02-0.04 | 0.01-0.02 |
| Residual Risk | Low | Medium | High |

### 4.2 Phased Implementation

1. **Pre-Decommissioning (1-2 years)**
   - Defueling and spent fuel transfer
   - System decontamination
   - Final radiological survey

2. **Active Dismantling (2-5 years)**
   - Non-radioactive systems removal
   - Decontamination of structures
   - Waste characterization and packaging

3. **Site Restoration (1-2 years)**
   - Final status survey
   - Regulatory verification
   - License termination

## 5. Regulatory Compliance Framework

### 5.1 International Standards
- **IAEA Safety Standards Series**
  - GSR Part 6: Decommissioning of Facilities
  - SSG-47: Decommissioning of Nuclear Power Plants
  - WS-G-5.1: Release of Sites from Regulatory Control

### 5.2 National Regulations
- **United States (10 CFR)**
  - Part 20: Standards for Protection Against Radiation
  - Part 50: Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization Facilities
  - Part 61: Licensing Requirements for Land Disposal of Radioactive Waste

- **European Union**
  - Council Directive 2013/59/EURATOM
  - Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC

## 6. Risk Management

### 6.1 Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Category | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Cost Overrun | Medium | High | Contingency (15-25%) |
| Schedule Delay | High | Medium | Critical path analysis |
| Worker Exposure | Low | High | ALARA optimization |
| Regulatory Hurdles | Medium | High | Early engagement |
| Waste Disposal | High | High | Multiple pathways |

### 6.2 Emergency Preparedness
- **Response Levels**:
  - Alert (unusual event)
  - Site Area Emergency
  - General Emergency
- **Response Time**:
  - On-site team: <15 minutes
  - Off-site support: <2 hours

## 7. Implementation Roadmap

### 7.1 Short-term (0-5 years)
- Complete decommissioning planning
- Establish waste processing facilities
- Train workforce
- Obtain regulatory approvals

### 7.2 Medium-term (5-20 years)
