# Vision Statement

## Our Aspiration
To establish a global standard for safe, sustainable, and accessible nuclear energy solutions through open collaboration and technological innovation, enabling a carbon-neutral future.

## Core Principles

### 1. Open Innovation
- **Open Source First**: All non-sensitive development conducted transparently
- **Collaborative Development**: Global community of experts contributing to shared goals
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Comprehensive documentation and training materials

### 2. Safety & Security
- **Inherent Safety**: Passive safety systems with multiple independent barriers
- **Defense in Depth**: Multi-layered protection against all hazards
- **Cybersecurity**: Zero-trust architecture for all digital systems

### 3. Sustainability
- **Waste Minimization**: Advanced fuel cycles reducing long-lived waste
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal utilization of nuclear materials
- **Environmental Stewardship**: Minimal ecological footprint throughout lifecycle

### 4. Accessibility
- **Modular Design**: Scalable solutions for diverse energy needs
- **Cost Competitiveness**: <$60/MWh LCOE for base load generation
- **Global Deployment**: Designs adaptable to various regulatory environments
