### 2. Enhance Safety
**Target:** Implement next-gen passive safety systems with 10x improved reliability

**Key Results:**
- **System Reliability**
  - Achieve Core Damage Frequency (CDF) <1E-7/ry
  - Implement 3+ independent safety systems for all design basis events
  - Reduce operator action time window to >72 hours for all accidents

- **Safety Culture**
  - Certify 100% of operators through competency-based training
  - Implement AI-assisted safety monitoring with >99.9% detection rate
  - Achieve zero safety-significant events during construction/operation

### 3. Reduce Costs
**Target:** Achieve 30% cost reduction through innovation

**Key Results:**
- **Capital Costs**
  - Reduce overnight capital cost to <$4,000/kWe by 2028
  - Achieve 90% design standardization across projects
  - Implement digital twin technology reducing rework by 40%

- **Operational Efficiency**
  - Achieve >90% capacity factor
  - Reduce O&M costs to <$20/MWh
  - Extend fuel cycle to >24 months
