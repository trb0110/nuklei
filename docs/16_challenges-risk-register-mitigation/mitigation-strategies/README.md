## 1. Introduction

This document outlines comprehensive mitigation strategies for addressing risks identified in the Nuklei project. It provides a structured approach to developing and implementing effective risk responses.

### 1.1 Purpose
- Guide the development of targeted mitigation actions
- Ensure consistent approach to risk treatment
- Support decision-making for risk response
- Document lessons learned for continuous improvement

### 1.2 Key Principles
- **Proactive**: Address risks before they become issues
- **Proportionate**: Scale response to risk level
- **Practical**: Implementable within project constraints
- **Proven**: Based on industry best practices

## 2. Mitigation Framework

### 2.1 Risk Treatment Options

### 2.2 Strategy Selection Matrix

| Strategy | When to Use | Pros | Cons | Example |
|----------|-------------|------|------|----------|
| **Avoid** | Risk is unacceptable | Eliminates threat | May limit opportunities | Change project scope |
| **Transfer** | Third party better manages risk | Reduces liability | May be costly | Insurance, contracts |
| **Mitigate** | Risk can be reduced | Reduces probability/impact | Requires resources | Redundant systems |
| **Accept** | Risk is minor | Cost-effective | Potential impact remains | Contingency planning |

## 4. Implementation Planning

### 4.1 Action Plan Template

| Action Item | Owner | Start Date | Due Date | Status | Resources | Dependencies |
|-------------|-------|------------|----------|--------|-----------|--------------|
 | Develop test protocol | QA Lead | 2025-02-01 | 2025-02-15 | Not Started | Test team, Equipment | Test plan approval |
 | Conduct safety review | Safety Officer | 2025-02-10 | 2025-02-28 | Planned | Safety team | Design freeze |
 | Update procedures | Process Engineer | 2025-02-15 | 2025-03-01 | Not Started | Documentation team | Review completion |

## 5. Effectiveness Monitoring

### 5.1 Key Performance Indicators

| KPI | Target | Current | Status |
|-----|--------|---------|--------|
| Risk reduction % | ≥80% | 65% | Below Target |
| Mitigation completion | 100% | 75% | On Track |
| Residual risk level | ≤Medium | High | Attention Needed |
| Implementation cost | ≤Budget | 85% of budget | On Track |

    "Not Started" : 20
```

## 6. Case Studies

### 6.1 Successful Mitigation: Supply Chain Disruption

**Challenge**: Critical component delivery delay (8 weeks)

**Actions Taken**:
1. Activated secondary supplier
2. Air freight expedited
3. Temporary workaround implemented

**Results**:
- 2-week delay (vs. 8 weeks)
- 15% cost increase (vs. 40% potential)
- No impact on critical path

### 6.2 Lessons Learned: Regulatory Compliance

**Issue**: New regulatory requirement identified late

**Root Cause**:
- Incomplete regulatory monitoring
- Lack of stakeholder engagement

**Improvements**:
- Established regulatory watch program
- Quarterly compliance reviews
- Early regulator consultation
