## 1. Introduction

This framework establishes a systematic approach to monitor and review risks throughout the Nuklei project lifecycle. It ensures that risk responses remain effective and aligned with project objectives.

### 1.1 Purpose
- Track risk mitigation effectiveness
- Identify emerging risks
- Ensure timely response to risk triggers
- Support data-driven decision making
- Maintain regulatory compliance

### 1.2 Scope
- All project phases (design, construction, operation, decommissioning)
- All risk categories (technical, schedule, cost, safety, etc.)
- All organizational levels (project team to executive leadership)

## 2. Monitoring Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Objectives
1. **Effectiveness**: Ensure risk responses achieve intended results
2. **Efficiency**: Optimize resource allocation for risk management
3. **Adaptability**: Respond to changing risk landscape
4. **Accountability**: Maintain clear ownership and responsibility
5. **Transparency**: Provide clear visibility into risk status

### 2.2 Monitoring Principles
- **Proactive**: Anticipate rather than react
- **Proportionate**: Scale monitoring to risk significance
- **Integrated**: Embed in regular project processes
- **Evidence-based**: Rely on objective data and metrics
- **Continuous**: Ongoing rather than periodic assessment

## 3. Key Performance Indicators

### 3.1 Risk Exposure Metrics

| KPI | Calculation | Target | Frequency | Owner |
|-----|------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Risk Exposure | Σ(Risk Probability × Impact) | < 100 | Monthly | Risk Manager |
| Risk Reduction | (Initial Exposure - Current Exposure) / Initial Exposure | > 50% | Quarterly | Risk Manager |
| Mitigation Effectiveness | (Planned - Actual Impact) / Planned Impact | > 80% | Per Milestone | Project Manager |
| Response Time | Time from risk identification to mitigation | < 5 days | Per Risk | Risk Owner |
| Residual Risk | Remaining risk after mitigation | < 10% | Monthly | Risk Manager |

### 3.2 Risk Appetite Metrics

    "Threshold" : 25

```

## 4. Reporting Structure

### 4.1 Report Types

| Report | Audience | Frequency | Content |
|--------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Executive Summary** | Senior Management | Monthly | High-level risk exposure, Top 5 risks, Strategic implications |
| **Operational Dashboard** | Project Team | Weekly | Risk status, Mitigation progress, Action items |
| **Technical Deep Dive** | Technical Leads | Bi-weekly | Technical risk analysis, Engineering solutions, Testing results |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Regulators | Quarterly | Compliance status, Incidents, Corrective actions |
| **Stakeholder Update** | External Parties | As needed | Project status, Risk outlook, Mitigation plans |
