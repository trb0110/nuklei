```

*Figure 3: Impact of Local Supply Chain on Construction Costs*

##### Key Observations:
1. **South Korea & China** maintain costs at $3,500-4,000/kWe through:
   - Standardized designs (e.g., APR1400, Hualong One)
   - Strong domestic supply chains (>60% local content)
   - Streamlined regulatory processes
   - Experienced construction teams with continuous build programs

2. **Western Countries** face higher costs ($6,000-11,000/kWe) due to:
   - First-of-a-kind (FOAK) engineering challenges
   - Regulatory changes during construction
   - Limited recent construction experience
   - Higher labor and material costs

3. **SMR Potential**:
   - Factory fabrication could reduce costs to $4,500-6,000/kWe
   - Learning curve benefits from serial production
   - Reduced on-site construction time and risk
