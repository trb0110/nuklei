*Figure 1: Decision Flow for Nuclear Projects*

### 1.1 Decision Hierarchy
- **Strategic Decisions** (Project viability, technology selection)
- **Tactical Decisions** (Design choices, procurement strategies)
- **Operational Decisions** (Construction sequencing, testing protocols)

### 1.2 Decision Gates
| Phase | Decision Point | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Concept | Project Initiation | Feasibility study, Market assessment |
| Definition | Technology Selection | Technology assessment, Preliminary design |
| Development | Final Investment Decision | Detailed design, Construction permits |
| Execution | Fuel Load Authorization | Construction completion, Commissioning tests |
| Operation | Commercial Operation | Operating license, Performance tests |
