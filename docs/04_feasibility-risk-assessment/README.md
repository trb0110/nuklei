# Feasibility & Risk Assessment

This section provides comprehensive guidance on evaluating the feasibility and risks associated with nuclear facility projects under the Nuklei framework.

## Overview

Feasibility and risk assessment are critical first steps in any nuclear project, ensuring that proposed facilities are technically sound, economically viable, and compliant with all regulatory requirements before significant resources are committed.

## Documentation Structure

1. [Technical Feasibility](./technical-feasibility.md) - Evaluation of technical requirements and constraints
2. [Economic Feasibility](./economic-feasibility.md) - Cost-benefit analysis and financial modeling
3. [Risk Assessment](./risk-assessment.md) - Identification and mitigation of project risks
4. [Regulatory Considerations](./regulatory-considerations.md) - Compliance with nuclear regulations
5. [Decision Framework](./decision-framework.md) - Methodology for go/no-go decisions

## Getting Started

1. Begin with the technical feasibility assessment to evaluate the project's technical viability
2. Proceed to economic feasibility once technical constraints are understood
3. Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment
4. Review regulatory requirements throughout the process
5. Use the decision framework to make informed project decisions
