## 2. Technical Analysis

### 2.1 Root Causes
1. **Direct Causes**
   - Beyond design basis tsunami height (14m vs. 5.7m design)
   - Loss of all AC/DC power (station blackout)
   - Failure of emergency diesel generators

2. **Contributing Factors**
   - Inadequate tsunami risk assessment
   - Insufficient defense-in-depth against flooding
   - Ineffective regulatory oversight

### 2.2 Safety System Performance

## 3. Accident Progression

### 3.1 Unit-by-Unit Analysis

#### Unit 1
- Complete core melt within hours
- Hydrogen explosion at reactor building
- PCV damage suspected

#### Unit 2
- Partial core damage
- Possible PCV failure
- No hydrogen explosion

#### Unit 3
- Complete core melt
- Hydrogen explosion

- Attempts to restore power and cooling

### 4.2 Challenges Faced
- Multiple simultaneous emergencies
- Communication failures
- Radiation monitoring limitations
- Access and logistics difficulties

## 5. Lessons Learned

### 5.1 Technical Improvements

   - Higher seawalls (15m+)
   - Watertight doors and penetrations
   - Elevated emergency equipment

2. **Power Supply**
   - Diverse AC power sources
   - Portable equipment readiness
   - Enhanced battery capacity

3. **Containment Venting**
   - Filtered venting systems
   - Reliable hydrogen control
   - Hardened vent paths

### 5.2 Regulatory Changes
