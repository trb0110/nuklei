# Severe Accident Management

This document outlines the comprehensive approach to managing severe accidents in nuclear power plants, focusing on prevention, mitigation, and emergency response strategies within the Nuklei framework.

## 1. Introduction to Severe Accidents

### 1.1 Definition
A severe accident is defined as an event sequence that leads to significant core degradation and potential loss of containment integrity, with possible off-site radiological consequences.

### 1.2 Historical Context
- Three Mile Island (1979)
- Chernobyl (1986)
- Fukushima Daiichi (2011)
- Lessons learned and regulatory changes

## 2. Severe Accident Phenomenology

### 2.1 Accident Progression
