# Contributor License Agreement

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to Nuklei. This license is for your protection as a contributor as well as the protection of Nuklei and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.

## 1. Definitions

- **"You"** (or **"Your"**) means the individual or legal entity that is making a Contribution to Nuklei.
- **"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Nuklei for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Nuklei (the "Work").
- **"Submit"** means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Nuklei or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Nuklei for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Nuklei and to recipients of software distributed by Nuklei a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Nuklei and to recipients of software distributed by Nuklei a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

## 4. You Represent and Warrant

1. You are legally entitled to grant the above license.
2. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to Nuklei, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Nuklei.
3. Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).
4. Your Contribution includes complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

## 5. Support and Maintenance

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND.

## 6. Outbound License

As a condition on the grant of rights in Sections 2 and 3, the Work distributed by Nuklei under any license must be under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) or such other compatible license(s) as may be designated by Nuklei.

## 7. Submitting on Behalf of Others

If You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Nuklei separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

## 8. No Implied License

Except as set forth in this Agreement, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

## 9. No Obligation

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any obligation for Nuklei to use or include Your Contribution in any product or service.
