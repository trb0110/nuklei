# Risk Assessment Framework

This document outlines the comprehensive risk assessment methodology for nuclear facility projects under the Nuklei framework.

## 1. Risk Management Process

### 1.1 Risk Identification
- **Hazard Analysis**
  - Internal hazards (reactor accidents, fires, explosions)
  - External hazards (seismic, flooding, aircraft impact)
  - Human-induced hazards (cyber attacks, sabotage)

- **Project Risks**
  - Schedule delays
  - Cost overruns
  - Technology maturity
  - Supply chain disruptions

### 1.2 Risk Analysis
- **Probability Assessment**
  - Historical data analysis
  - Expert judgment
  - Fault tree analysis
  - Event tree analysis

- **Consequence Assessment**
  - Safety impacts
  - Environmental impacts
  - Economic impacts
  - Reputational impacts

### 1.3 Risk Evaluation

#### Risk Acceptance Criteria
- **Low Risk (Green)**: Acceptable with routine monitoring
- **Medium Risk (Yellow)**: Requires mitigation actions and monitoring
- **High Risk (Red)**: Unacceptable - requires immediate action

#### Risk Prioritization
1. High probability & High impact
2. High probability & Medium impact
3. Medium probability & High impact
4. Medium probability & Medium impact
5. Low probability & High impact
6. Low probability & Medium impact
7. Low probability & Low impact
