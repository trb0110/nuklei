# Digital Instrumentation & Cybersecurity

## Overview
This section provides comprehensive guidance on the digital instrumentation and control (I&C) systems and cybersecurity measures for nuclear facilities. It covers the design, implementation, and maintenance of secure and reliable digital systems that meet nuclear industry standards and regulatory requirements.

## Documentation Structure

### 7.1 I&C Platform Blueprint
- [I&C Platform Architecture](iac-platform/README.md)
- System Requirements and Specifications
- Hardware and Software Components
- Integration with Safety Systems
- Testing and Validation Procedures

### 7.2 Network Architecture & Zero-Trust
- [Network Design Principles](network-architecture/README.md)
- Zero-Trust Security Model
- Network Segmentation
- Secure Communication Protocols
- Intrusion Detection and Prevention

### 7.3 Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
- [SBOM Management Framework](sbom/README.md)
- Component Inventory
- Vulnerability Management
- Supply Chain Security
- Compliance Verification

## Key Principles

### Security by Design
- Defense-in-depth approach
- Least privilege implementation
- Secure development lifecycle
- Continuous monitoring and improvement

### Regulatory Compliance
- NRC 10 CFR 73.54 (Cybersecurity Requirements)
- IEC 61513 (Nuclear I&C Systems)
- ISA/IEC 62443 (Industrial Automation and Control Systems Security)
